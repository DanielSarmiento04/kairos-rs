# Kairos-rs Development Roadmap

> **Version**: 0.2.9  
> **Last Updated**: October 2025  
> **Status**: Production Ready with Multi-Protocol Support

## ðŸ”¥ Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Configuration Editor UI** - Build JWT and rate limiting management interface
2. **WebSocket Real-time Updates** - Replace polling with WebSocket for live metrics
3. **Form Validation** - Add comprehensive client and server-side validation
4. **Historical Metrics** - Store and display time-series data with charts
5. **Request Transformation** - Header manipulation and path rewriting

## ðŸ¤– AI/LLM Gateway Vision

**Innovative Use Cases for AI-Powered API Gateway:**

### Smart Request Routing
- **Content Analysis**: Route `/api/translate` requests to different translation services based on detected language complexity
- **Load Prediction**: Use ML to predict which backend will handle requests most efficiently
- **Failover Intelligence**: AI-driven decisions on when and where to route during service degradation

### LLM-Enhanced Request Processing
- **Request Transformation**: Convert REST to GraphQL automatically based on request intent
- **Response Enrichment**: Use LLMs to add context or explanations to API responses
- **Query Optimization**: Automatically optimize database queries or API calls using AI insights

### Intelligent Rate Limiting & Security
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect abnormal request patterns and adjust rate limits dynamically
- **Threat Detection**: Use AI to identify potential attacks or abuse patterns
- **Personalized Limits**: Adjust rate limits based on user behavior and request complexity

### Developer Experience AI
- **Auto-Documentation**: Generate API documentation from request/response patterns
- **Performance Insights**: AI-generated recommendations for API optimization
- **Configuration Assistance**: Smart suggestions for gateway configuration based on usage patterns

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with simple ML models for load balancing
- Integrate with popular LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Build plugin architecture for custom AI modules
- Focus on performance - AI decisions should add <5ms latency

## Success Metricsent load balancing strategies** - Round-robin, weighted, health-based
2. **Add retry logic with backoff** - Configurable retry policies  
3. **Request transformation** - Header manipulation, path rewriting
4. **Performance optimizations** - Connection pooling improvements
5. **Enhanced documentation** - Add JWT and rate limiting examplesus**: Development mode

## What is this?

This roadmap shows what we're planning to build for Kairos-rs. It's honest about current state and future plans.

**Current Reality**: We have a production-ready HTTP gateway with JWT auth, rate limiting, circuit breakers, metrics, **and a modern web-based admin interface**.

**Future Vision**: A comprehensive API management platform with AI-powered routing capabilities that developers love to use.

## Current Status (What Actually Works)

- âœ… **Multi-protocol support** - HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, FTP, and DNS proxying
- âœ… Basic HTTP request routing with regex pattern matching
- âœ… Dynamic path parameters (`/users/{id}` â†’ `/users/123`)
- âœ… JSON configuration with comprehensive validation
- âœ… **JWT Authentication** - Bearer token validation with configurable claims
- âœ… **Advanced rate limiting** - Per-route limits with multiple algorithms (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket)
- âœ… **Load Balancing** - 5 strategies (round-robin, least connections, random, weighted, IP hash)
- âœ… **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff with configurable policies and retryable status codes
- âœ… **Route Management API** - CRUD operations via REST endpoints for dynamic route configuration
- âœ… **Hot-Reload API** - Manual configuration reload and status endpoints
- âœ… Request logging with structured output
- âœ… **Security headers** - CORS, content security policies, request size limits
- âœ… **Health check endpoints** - `/health`, `/ready`, `/live` for Kubernetes
- âœ… **Circuit breaker pattern** - Per-backend circuit breakers with fault isolation
- âœ… **Configuration hot-reload** - Update routes without service restart
- âœ… **Prometheus metrics** - Comprehensive observability with `/metrics` endpoint
- âœ… **Web Admin UI** - Modern Leptos-based interface with real-time dashboard
- âœ… **Workspace Architecture** - Modular crates: gateway, ui, cli, client, core
- âœ… **WebSocket proxying** - Real-time bidirectional communication support
- âœ… **FTP proxying** - File operations through HTTP APIs
- âœ… **DNS proxying** - DNS query forwarding with caching
- âœ… 90+ comprehensive tests (unit, integration, documentation, load balancing)

**Performance**: 
- ~200k route matches/sec on M1 MacBook Pro
- P99 latency < 2ms for route matching
- Handles 10k+ concurrent requests reliably
- Memory usage: ~25MB under load

## What's Missing (Honestly)

- No response caching layer (HTTP only)
- No service discovery integration
- No request transformation (header manipulation, path rewriting) - planned for next release
- No gRPC proxying (planned for future)
- No distributed tracing integration (OpenTelemetry planned)
- **Partial Admin UI** - Dashboard and health monitoring working, configuration editor UI in progress
- No historical metrics with time-series charts yet
- **Protocol-specific features**:
  - WebSocket: Advanced compression and custom protocol extensions
  - FTP: FTPS/SFTP support and advanced file operations
  - DNS: TCP support and DNSSEC validation

**Recently Added (v0.2.9):**
- âœ… **Multi-protocol support** - WebSocket, FTP, and DNS proxying
- âœ… **Protocol-specific validation** - Comprehensive validation for each protocol
- âœ… **Protocol services** - WebSocket handler, FTP operations, DNS forwarding with cache
- âœ… **HTTP API wrappers** - FTP and DNS operations accessible via REST APIs
