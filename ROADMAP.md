#  Kairos-rs Development Roadmap

> **Version**: 0.2.6.
> **Last Updated**: September 24, 2025  
>## 🔥 Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Implement load balancing strategies** - Round-robin, weighted, health-based
2. **Add retry logic with backoff** - Configurable retry policies  
3. **Request transformation** - Header manipulation, path rewriting
4. **Performance optimizations** - Connection pooling improvements
5. **Enhanced documentation** - Add JWT and rate limiting examplesus**: Development mode

## What is this?

This roadmap shows what we're planning to build for Kairos-rs. It's honest about current state and future plans.

**Current Reality**: We have a basic HTTP gateway that works for simple routing with dynamic path parameters. That's it.

**Future Vision**: A solid, reliable gateway that developers actually want to use.

## 🎯 Current Status (What Actually Works)

- ✅ Basic HTTP request routing
- ✅ Dynamic path parameters (`/users/{id}` → `/users/123`)
- ✅ JSON configuration with validation
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - Bearer token validation with configurable claims
- ✅ **Advanced rate limiting** - Per-route limits with multiple algorithms (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket)
- ✅ Request logging with structured output
- ✅ **Security headers** - CORS, content security policies
- ✅ **Health check endpoints** - `/health` and `/metrics`
- ✅ **Circuit breaker pattern** - Fail-fast when services are down
- ✅ **Configuration hot-reload** - Update routes without restart
- ✅ 81+ comprehensive tests (unit, integration, documentation)

**Performance**: ~200k route matches/sec on M1 MacBook Pro

## 🚧 What's Missing (Honestly)

- No load balancing strategies
- No caching layer
- No admin UI
- No service discovery
- No request transformation
- Limited WebSocket support
- No gRPC proxying
- No distributed tracing integration

## 📅 Development Plan

### Phase 1: Make it Production Usable (Next 1-2 months) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Something you could actually deploy and not be embarrassed about

#### Week 1-2: Core Reliability ✅ DONE
- ✅ **Better error handling** - Proper error responses, timeouts
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Fail fast on bad config
- ✅ **Graceful shutdown** - Handle SIGTERM properly
- ✅ **Basic metrics endpoint** - Prometheus-compatible `/metrics`

#### Week 3-4: Security Basics ✅ DONE  
- ✅ **JWT validation** - Validate bearer tokens with configurable claims
- ✅ **Request size limits** - Prevent large payload attacks
- ✅ **CORS support** - Configurable CORS policies
- ✅ **Rate limiting improvements** - Per-route limits with multiple algorithms

#### Week 5-8: Monitoring & Ops ✅ DONE
- ✅ **Health checks** - Check upstream service health
- ✅ **Request tracing** - Add correlation IDs
- ✅ **Better logging** - Structured JSON logging
- ✅ **Configuration hot-reload** - Update routes without restart

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED
- ✅ Can handle 10k+ RPS reliably
- ✅ Has comprehensive observability
- ✅ Won't fall over under normal load
- ✅ Has security features for public APIs

### Phase 2: Advanced Routing (CURRENT FOCUS)
**Goal**: Handle complex routing scenarios

- [ ] **Load balancing** - Round robin, weighted, health-based
- ✅ **Circuit breakers** - Fail fast when upstreams are down
- [ ] **Retry logic** - Configurable retry with backoff
- [ ] **Request transformation** - Modify headers/paths before forwarding

### Phase 3: Performance & Scale (Months 3-4)
**Goal**: Handle serious production loads

- [ ] **Response caching** - In-memory and Redis backends
- [ ] **Connection pooling optimization** - Better upstream connections
- [ ] **Compression** - gzip/brotli response compression
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** - Latency histograms, throughput

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Months 4-6)
**Goal**: Make it easy to use and manage

- [ ] **Admin UI** - Web interface for configuration
- [ ] **CLI tool** - Command-line management
- [ ] **Better documentation** - Real examples, tutorials
- [ ] **Deployment guides** - Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

## � Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Fix configuration validation** - Currently accepts invalid configs
2. **Add proper error responses** - Return structured JSON errors  
3. **Implement basic metrics** - Add `/metrics` endpoint
4. **Write more tests** - Integration tests for error cases
5. **Improve documentation** - Add more real-world examples

## 💡 Feature Requests We've Received

Based on early feedback:

- ✅ **JWT authentication** - COMPLETED - Most requested feature
- [ ] **Load balancing** - IN PROGRESS - Needed for HA deployments  
- ✅ **Metrics/monitoring** - COMPLETED - Required for production use
- ✅ **Better error handling** - COMPLETED - Current errors are helpful
- [ ] **Request transformation** - PLANNED - Header manipulation, path rewriting

## 🤝 How You Can Help

**If you're interested in contributing:**

1. **Try it out** - Use it for a simple project and report issues
2. **Pick a small feature** - Choose something from Phase 1
3. **Improve documentation** - Add examples, fix typos
4. **Write tests** - We need more edge case coverage
5. **Performance testing** - Load test and find bottlenecks

**Good first issues:**
- Add load balancing strategies
- Implement request transformation
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Write examples for JWT authentication
- Performance testing and optimization

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Technical Goals:**
- Handle 50k+ RPS (currently ~10k)
- P99 latency under 5ms (currently ~2ms)
- 99.9% uptime in production use
- Zero memory leaks under load

**Community Goals:**
- 10+ contributors
- 100+ GitHub stars  
- Used in at least 5 real projects
- Active issue discussions

## ⚠️ Things We Won't Do

**Out of scope** (at least for now):
- WebSocket proxying
- gRPC support  
- Complex authentication flows
- Service mesh features
- Database integration
- Message queue integration

We want to do HTTP proxying really well before expanding scope.

## 🔄 How This Roadmap Changes

This roadmap will evolve based on:
- User feedback and feature requests
- Technical discoveries during implementation  
- Available contributor time and interest
- Real-world usage patterns

**Last major update**: September 24, 2025 - Updated with completed Phase 1 features (JWT auth, advanced rate limiting, circuit breakers, metrics)
