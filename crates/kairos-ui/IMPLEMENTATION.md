## 🚀 How to Run

### Development Mode
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start gateway
cd crates/kairos-gateway
cargo run

# Terminal 2: Start UI dev server
cd crates/kairos-ui
cargo leptos serve

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Build
```bash
cd crates/kairos-ui
cargo leptos build --release
./target/release/kairos-ui
```

## 📊 Current Status

### What Works Now
✅ Dashboard with live metrics  
✅ Health monitoring  
✅ Navigation and routing  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Auto-refresh (30s)  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Loading states  

### What Needs Backend Support
⏳ Route CRUD operations (needs backend endpoints)  
⏳ Configuration editing (needs backend endpoints)  
⏳ Historical metrics (needs backend storage)  
⏳ WebSocket support (needs backend implementation)  

### What's Stubbed for Future Development
📝 Routes management page (UI ready, needs API)  
📝 Advanced metrics page (UI ready, needs data)  
📝 Configuration editor (UI ready, needs API)  

## 🎓 Following Best Practices

   - Resources for data fetching
   - Suspense for loading states
   - SSR with hydration
   - Component composition

## 🔄 Roadmap Alignment

This implementation addresses items from `ROADMAP.md`:

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Basic structure and components
- ✅ Dashboard with metrics
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Navigation and routing
- ✅ Professional styling

### Phase 2: Next Steps
- [ ] Implement route CRUD (needs backend endpoints)
- [ ] Configuration editor (needs backend endpoints)
- [ ] Advanced metrics visualization
- [ ] Historical data support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Charts and graphs
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Export functionality

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Backend Dependencies**: Many features are stubbed awaiting backend API endpoints
2. **No Historical Data**: Only current metrics, no time-series storage yet
3. **No Authentication**: UI doesn't implement auth (gateway handles it)
4. **Limited Charts**: Basic histogram, no advanced charts yet
5. **No WebSocket**: Polling-based refresh instead of push updates

## 📝 Next Actions

### For Backend Developer
1. Implement configuration GET/POST endpoints
2. Add route management API (list, create, update, delete)
3. Consider WebSocket support for real-time updates
4. Add historical metrics storage

### For Frontend Developer
1. Implement route management forms
2. Build configuration editor UI
3. Add chart library for metrics visualization
4. Implement WebSocket client support
5. Add authentication UI if needed

### For Both
1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Security hardening
4. Documentation expansion

## ✅ Checklist
