WebSocket Implementation Note
==============================

The WebSocket service requires proper integration with actix-ws.
The actix-ws::Session API doesn't provide a split() method like futures streams.

Proper implementation should:
1. Use actix_ws::handle() to upgrade the HTTP connection
2. Forward messages bidirectionally using session.text(), session.binary(), etc.
3. Handle the MessageStream from actix-ws for receiving client messages
4. Connect to backend using tokio-tungstenite

Current implementation needs refactoring to use the correct actix-ws API patterns.
